### Visual & UX Inspiration
* soft colors for homepage

### HTML/CSS/JS Skills I plan to use
* Breadcrumbs for Navigation
* Cards (make each polaroid clickable, instead of having to click on the words)
* Lazy loading (since I have A LOT of pics)
* Save feature (heart button for people to save
 for there travel wishlist)
 * Photo Tagging & Hover Effects (When hovering a photo, show a quick fact, travel story, or location pin, or all)
 * Add a world map ???
 * When I click on the logo it takes users back to homepage
 * add my personal social media
